	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thirty-two patients with HCC who underwent DEB-TACE were enrolled in this study. Enhancement patterns of vascular phase images on CEUS were compared before and within 3 days after DEB-TACE, and the patterns after DEB-TACE were classified as follows: Pattern A, no enhancement; Pattern B, peripheral ring enhancement; Pattern C, partial enhancement within or peripheral to tumors, and Pattern D, reduced or unchanged enhancement in the whole tumor. Enhancement patterns in all lesions and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) findings after DEB-TACE were compared statistically. The treatment response of DEB-TACE was evaluated using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) by CECT. The enhancement patterns on CEUS performed within 3 days after DEB-TACE were defined as Pattern A in 17 cases, B in 7, C in 13, and D in 2. The complete response rates at one month after treatment were 94.1\% (16/17 lesions) for Pattern A, 85.7\% (6/7) for B, 15.4\% (2/13) for C, and 50\% (1/2) for D. The response rates were significantly higher for lesions with Pattern A compared to those with Pattern C at one month (p = 0.009) and 12 months (p {\textless} 0.001) after treatment, and significantly higher for lesions with Pattern B compared to those with Pattern C at 12 months after treatment (p = 0.031). Comparisons between other patterns showed no significant differences. CEUS immediately after DEB-TACE may allow early assessment of therapeutic efficacy, with findings of no enhancement or peripheral ring enhancement suggesting a positive outcome.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US), compared with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), for early assessments after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with 59 HCC lesions who were scheduled to receive TACE were enrolled in this prospective study. TACE was performed by injecting a mixture of iodized oil and miriplatin hydrate, followed by a gelatin sponge. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and/or contrast-enhanced CT were performed 2-6 months after TACE and were used as the reference standard for residual HCC; the detection rates for residual viable HCC using contrast-enhanced US with a perflubutane-based contrast agent and a high mechanical index (MI) mode performed one day after TACE were also compared with those obtained using contrast-enhanced CT performed one month after TACE. The comparisons were made using the McNemar test.
RESULTS: Forty-seven (79.7\%) of the 59 HCC lesions were diagnosed as having residual viability based on DSA and contrast-enhanced CT findings obtained 2-6 months after TACE. Eight (17.0\%) of the 47 HCC lesions that were diagnosed as having residual viability using one-day contrast-enhanced US were not detected using one-month contrast-enhanced CT because of artifacts produced by the high attenuation of the iodized oil. The detection rate for residual HCC lesions using one-day contrast-enhanced US (95.7\%, 45/47) was significantly higher than that using one-month contrast-enhanced CT (78.7\%, 37/47) (P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced US performed one day after TACE is more sensitive than contrast-enhanced CT performed one month after TACE for detecting residual viable HCC.},

	abstract = {Objectives We aimed to investigate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could be useful for early evaluation of the treatment response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods This study retrospectively selected HCCs in which homogeneous retention of iodized oil was confirmed on non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed immediately after TACE. Therapeutic responses of HCCs were evaluated by CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE and by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) approximately 4 weeks after TACE. We investigated the noninferiority of CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE to CECT approximately 4 weeks after TACE in terms of the diagnostic accuracy of the therapeutic response to TACE on HCC. Results Eighty-nine HCCs were enrolled in this study between April 2014 and June 2016. A complete response was observed in 57 of 89 nodules (64.0\%), and an incomplete response was observed in the remaining 32 nodules (36.0\%). The accuracy rates for CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE and CECT approximately 4 weeks after TACE in the therapeutic effect of TACE on HCCs were 83.1\% (95\% confidence interval, 73.7\%–90.2\%) and 83.1\% (95\% confidence interval, 73.7\%–90.2\%), respectively. The difference in diagnostic accuracy between methods was 0\%, which was below the predetermined noninferiority limit of 15\%, and CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE was noninferior to CECT approximately 4 weeks after TACE. Conclusions Our results suggest that CEUS is a useful modality for early therapeutic evaluation of TACE for HCC, and we can thus plan the next treatment strategies for HCC within a few days after TACE.},
