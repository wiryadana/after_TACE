When negative enhancement was confirmed by both CEUS and CECT, both modalities were performed again on the same day approximately 16 weeks after TACE.","When microbubbles were present nodularly within the tumor, the tumor was defined as showing positive enhancement. When no microbubble signal was present within the tumor, the tumor was defined
as showing negative enhancement.","miriplatin (Miripla; DainipponSumitomo Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) suspended in iodized oil (Ultra-Fluid; Dainippon-Sumitomo Pharmaceutical) was injected into the hepatic artery under balloon occlusion. Thereafter, 1-mm gelatin sponge particles (Gerpart; Nippon Kayaku, Tokyo, Japan) were injected to completely obstruct the tumor-feeding artery"
